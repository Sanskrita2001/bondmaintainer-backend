# bondmaintainer-backend


## Running on Local System

Running the project on local system is **strongly recommended**, even if you are not working on the backend. This is becuase to test the middlewars, client applications, or any other component, an instance of Bond Maintainer server is required. Make sure that you have a mongodb instance running. This step might be different depending on your installation type. If you do not have mongodb database installed, refer [this link](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

- Clone the repository to your system using `git clone https://github.com/bondmaintainer/bondmaintainer-backend`
- Now open the cloned repository using `cd bondmaintainer-backend`
- The project depends on numerous npm packages. Install them using `yarn install` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to launch a development server.
- Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:5000) and ensure that the server is running.
